# Bias Lighting project
---
This sketch runs on an arduino mini behind my tv
This is designed to work with Mute, vol up and vol down on my TLC roku remote since I use an external sound bar and those buttons were non functional.

The circuit uses a arduino pro mini, standard IR receiver, buck converter for 5v supply, 12v power adapter, and an n-channel mosfet for toggling the strip. 

The lights will blink twice once max brightness is reached to let you know visually.
